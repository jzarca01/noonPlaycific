# noonPlaycific

A cool tool to help you export Noon Pacific weekly playlists to Spotify, Deezer and Napster

## How to use

```
npm install
node index.js --mixtape noon-265 --provider spotify
```

## Options

```
--mixtape -m [noon-265|ldn-016|nyc-016] (or any other slug, just look at their website)
--provider -p [spotify|deezer|napster]
```

## Wait, my freshly created playlist is empty/only has x songs in it
Deezer or Napster's catalog is not as big as Spotify's

## When I try to create a playlist in Napster, all I got is a blank screen
For now you can go to ```http://localhost:8883```
